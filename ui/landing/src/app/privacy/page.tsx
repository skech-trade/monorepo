          skech is a Bitcoin price prediction game. You draw where you think Bitcoin&rsquo;s price goes over the next few
          seconds. The parts of your line the price passes through pay a set multiple. The parts it misses, you lose what
          you put on them.

        <P>
          This policy covers this website (skech.trade), the web app (app.skech.trade) and the skech Android app.
