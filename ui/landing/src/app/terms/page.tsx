        <P>
          skech is a Bitcoin price prediction game. You draw where you think Bitcoin&rsquo;s price goes over the next few
          seconds. The parts of your line the price passes through pay a set multiple. The parts it misses, you lose what
          you put on them.
        </P>
        <List>
          <li>You draw on a live Bitcoin chart, up to 30 seconds ahead.</li>
          <li>You choose what each dot of ink costs. A line costs that amount times the ink it uses.</li>
          <li>Your ink is placed as you draw, in small pieces. Each piece is a transaction on the blockchain.</li>
          <li>
            Each part of a piece gets a multiple when it is placed, from 1&times; to 128&times;. The less likely the price
            is to reach it, the higher the multiple. The chart shows these multiples before you draw.
          </li>
          <li>
            When each second ends, every part of your ink the price passed through in that second pays its multiple of
            what you put on it. Every part it missed is lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            <Em>The multiples are set so that, on average, players get back less than they put in.</Em>
          </li>
          <li>If a second&rsquo;s price is never recorded on the blockchain, what you put on that second is returned.</li>
        </List>
        <P>
          The price is Coinbase&rsquo;s BTC-USD price, checked against other exchanges by our servers and recorded on the blockchain each second.
          That recorded price decides every result.
