 * Signing in.
 *
 * Privy embedded wallets: email, phone, Google or Apple, no extension to
 * install and no seed phrase to write down. The wallet is an EOA rather than
 * a smart account, so it can sign a plain message off chain.
 *
 * With no app id configured the app runs signed out and everything else
 * still works, which is what the tests and screenshots use. Privy's hooks
 * only work inside their provider, so they are read in one component that
 * only mounts there (privy.tsx) and published through context; everyone else
 * reads the context and calls exactly one hook however the build is configured.
 *
 * Privy's SDK is over half a megabyte, so it is not in the page's first load: it
 * comes in its own chunk once the page is up, and mounts beside the app, not
 * around it, so its arrival re-renders nothing but the account.
