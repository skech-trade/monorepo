 * of area it covers costs the same and pays what the map says there, if the
 * price runs through it. The ink is solid where it is in play, faint where
 * it is not (too soon, too near the price, too far from it), and green where
 * the price has been through it.
 *

 * is drawn.

 * sixty frames a second of moving ink is not a job for React. The screen
 * owns the rules and the money; this owns the picture and the pen.
