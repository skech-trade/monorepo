/*
  How the game feels: sound and touch.

  Every sound is synthesized here, nothing is downloaded, so the first tap is
  heard as soon as it lands. Everything runs through one bus with a
  compressor on it: ten hits in one second stay loud without clipping.

  The rules the sounds follow:
  - A tap is heard the instant the finger lands, as a drop of ink.
  - Drawing sounds like a pen on paper: a soft scratch that follows the hand's speed and stops with it.
  - Only profit is celebrated. Every hit pays more than its own ink cost, so every hit is heard the instant the price
    touches the ink, in the same frame as its "+$x": a bell, a step higher for each hit in a row, a big one with notes
    over it.
  - A round that came out ahead rings up its chord, fuller the more it made, a step up the scale for each profitable
    round in a row (back to the root after one that was not), and the till rings as the money lands in the balance.
  - A round that lost makes no sound and no touch.
  - One at a time: see feel(), at the bottom.
  - Anything refused is a short low double note, never a buzzer.

  The celebrations (packages/core/src/cheer.ts) are made once, a slice at a time while the page is idle, and kept:
  each then plays as one buffer, never a dozen oscillators wired up in the middle of a frame.
