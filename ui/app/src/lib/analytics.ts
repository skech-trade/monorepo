/**
 * What the app tells PostHog, and nothing else.
 *
 * On the free plan (1M events, 5k replays and 100k exceptions a month), so
 * every event here is one somebody will read: the way in (ready, sign in,
 * deposit, the drawing key, the first drawing), each round's result, the
 * money out, what fails, and one summary a visit for how long it was played.
 * Errors are Sentry's (src/lib/sentry.ts), not PostHog's: each event here is
 * also left there as a breadcrumb, so an error shows the play that led to it.
 * Autocapture, heatmaps and dead clicks are off: on a canvas game they are
 * mostly noise, and they would spend the plan on it.
 *
 * Off unless NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY is set, and off in development unless
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_DEV=1, so a laptop never counts against the plan.
 * Events go through /ingest on our own domain (next.config.ts), past ad
 * blockers. Identity is the wallet address, never an email or phone number.
 *
 * PostHog itself (about 110 KB gzipped) is loaded once the page has painted
 * and the browser is idle, not before the game can be seen; what is tracked
 * before then waits for it.
