 *
 * The chances are measured on Coinbase's own trades, folded into one-second
 * bars (`packages/core/scripts/fetch-coinbase.ts`), so the game is played on
 * the same market, folded the same way. On connect the engine sends the last
 * ten minutes of trades, then every trade as it lands. Each is checked against
 * Binance and Kraken and signed by the engine's wallet as EIP-712 typed data a
 * contract can check (`packages/contracts/evm`). The price shown is always the
 * price signed: what a trade placed now would post on chain. What is signed,
 * and on whose agreement, is in the engine's log.
 *
 * The engine passes on Coinbase's heartbeat every second, so a stream that
 * goes quiet without closing is caught and reopened rather than left showing
 * a stale price.
