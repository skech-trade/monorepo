/**
 * A formula for the odds, fitted and backtested, and not used: see
 * docs/INK.md, "A formula for the odds, and why it is not used". Kept so the
 * result can be reproduced; the game prices on measured chances
 * (`src/odds.ts`).
 *
 * A point is a row of prices, `lo` to `hi`, during one second, `j` seconds
 * after a drawing opens. The price is measured in volatilities from where it
 * stood when the drawing opened: `z = ln(price / now) / sigma`, where
 * `sigma` is the market's one-second volatility (`dots.ts`, read on
 * five-second moves). In those units:
 *
 *   where it is by the start of the second    X ~ Normal(mu * j, v^2 * j)
 *     mu = drift * momentum                   (the last three seconds' move)
 *   a point it is not already in is touched   2 * Phi(-gap / s)
 *     within the second, if it is `gap` away  (the reflection principle)
 *     s  = v * (swing0 + swing1 * wick)       (how far a second swings, from
 *                                              how far they have lately)
 *   and every so often the market jumps:      a share `tail` of the time,
 *                                              all of the above with v * tailVol
 *   but often it has not moved at all:        stays = exp(-k * j^shape),
 *     Bitcoin trades on a tick, and in a       k = stay0 * (sigma / 5e-5)^stay1
 *     quiet market it sits on one for seconds   (the row it is in is hit;
 *                                              no other is)
 *
 *   moved  = integral over X of  1                          if lo <= X < hi
 *                                2 * Phi(-gap(X) / s)       otherwise
 *   chance = stays * [lo <= now < hi] + (1 - stays) * moved
 *
 *   multiple = rtp / chance, rounded down; not offered under 1.01x or over 50x
 *
 * `rtp` is the share of a stake a point returns on average, and less on the
 * side the market just moved towards (`rtpAt` in `dots.ts`); the house keeps
 * the rest. The constants in `ODDS` are fitted to 16,000 real thirty-second
 * stretches of Binance BTCUSDT (`scripts/fit-odds.ts`), and what they come to
 * is checked on days the fit never saw (`scripts/check-ink.ts`).
