/**
 * Legacy per-row odds. The active practice game uses roundedTerms below
 * (ladder-v1); see docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md.
 *
 * The original odds: everything the game says about a line, from one place.
 *
 * The map's labels, the pen's "10x · $2.50", the ticket while drawing, what
 * a line costs, what a hit pays, and the server's settlement once there is
 * money in it all come from `terms`. Nothing else works any of it out.
 *
 *   a row       step * PEN_CELLS[pen] dollars tall: a wider pen, taller rows
 *   a point     each second a line passes through a row, once (`cellsOf`)
 *   cost        perPoint * the points in play
 *   chance      how often the price trades in that row in that second, as
 *               measured on 16,000 real thirty-second stretches of Bitcoin
 *               from moments like this one (`field` in `dots.ts`)
 *   multiple    rtp / chance, rounded down; not offered under 1.01x or over
 *               50x. rtp is 0.85, less on the side the market just moved
 *               towards (`rtpAt`)
 *   a hit pays  perPoint * multiple, rounded down to the cent
 *   the house   keeps 1 - rtp of every point on average
 *
 * So the pen changes the multiples (a taller row is hit more often and pays
 * less), and what a point costs changes the dollars (a hit pays the point
 * times its multiple), never the multiple: if it did, a bigger bet would be
 * a worse one.
 *
 * Why the chance is measured and not a formula: one was fitted
 * (`scripts/odds-formula.ts`) and it lost on both ends. On
 * days it never saw, ordinary lines got back 0.45 to 0.75 a dollar, and a
 * player who knew the real odds and drew only where the formula was wrong
 * got back up to 1.21. Bitcoin a second at a time sits on a tick, jumps,
 * and carries on after a jump, and a smooth formula misses all three.
