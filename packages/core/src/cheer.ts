 *   broke even, is tier 0, and is neither heard nor felt.
 * - `climb`: how far up the scale a run of profitable rounds has gone. Each one in a row rings a step higher, up to
 *   an octave; a round that does not come out ahead starts it again from the root.
 * - The sounds themselves (`voiceJob`): made here, sample by sample, rather than wired up from oscillators each time
 *   one plays. Each is made once, a slice at a time while nothing else is going on, and kept; playing one is then a
 *   single buffer, pitched up the scale by its playback rate. Each is a bright bell-like main tone, a soft shimmer
 *   over it (two partials a few cents apart, beating slowly), and a small room's reverb under it, and each is scaled
 *   to its own peak, so none can clip however they overlap on the way out.
 *
 * Pure functions over plain numbers: no audio API is touched here, so the tests can hear (and measure) every sample.
