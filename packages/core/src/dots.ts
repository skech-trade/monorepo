/**
 * skech: paint dots ahead of the price. Every dot the price passes through pays.
 *
 * The space ahead of now is a field of dots: one second wide, one price step
 * tall. You paint over them, and every dot you paint is a bet of the same
 * size, set by you (a dime a dot, say). So a drawing costs its area. A dot
 * pays its own multiple when the price passes through it: dots close to the
 * price, and soon, are likely and pay a little; dots far from it, in price
 * or in time, are unlikely and pay a lot.
 *
 * How likely is measured, not modelled: the field is laid over thousands of
 * real thirty-second stretches of Bitcoin, taken from moments that looked
 * like this one (as busy, moving the same way), and the share of them that
 * passed through a dot is its chance. A dot pays `rtp / chance`, so every
 * dot returns the same on average wherever it is: the house keeps the same
 * share of a long shot as of a sure thing.
 *
 * Time runs in whole seconds, as the price data does. A drawing opens on the
 * second after it is placed and is priced there, on everything known by
 * then. The second after that is never part of it, so nobody can react
 * faster than the bet. A dot is hit when its second's trades reach its step.
 *
 * Pure functions over plain data: the page runs it for free play, and the
 * server can run the same code once there is money in it.
