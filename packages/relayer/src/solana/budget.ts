/**
 * What the Solana relayer may ask of its RPC: a request budget, shared by everything it asks. The public devnet RPC
 * turned it away (HTTP 429) every two seconds, until transactions expired unsent; a private one has a plan's limit,
 * and on mainnet every request is billed.
 *
 * - A token bucket, `SOLANA_RPC_RPS` a second. Requests wait their turn by what they are for: a transaction going
 *   out first, then looking for those in flight, then the blockhash and fee, then reads for players, then the sweep.
 * - A 429 stops every request, for the RPC's `Retry-After` or, without one, a wait that doubles while they keep
 *   coming, with jitter. A request turned away goes again after it, a few times; a status look does not, since the
 *   next look asks again anyway, and the poller takes no answer as "not known yet" (confirm.ts).
 * - Two reads of the same thing at once are one request.
 * - 429s are logged at most every 30 s, with how many there were.
