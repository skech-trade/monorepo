/**
 * The social service on its own, reading the game from the chain and placing nothing: for working on the community
 * pages against a live game without running a relayer (which would need, and contend with, the live relayer's key).
 *
 *   SOCIAL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://… bun run --filter @skech/relayer social
 *
 * The game is `packages/contracts/deployments/solana-<SKECH_SOLANA_CLUSTER>.json` (devnet unless it says otherwise);
 * the RPC is SOLANA_<CLUSTER>_RPC_URL, or the cluster's public one. Drawings come from the chain's events, which keep
 * only a stroke's hash: they count, but have no shape to draw.
