//! A piece of a drawing, as its player's session key signs it, and how the program knows the key signed it.
//!
//! The session key signs the piece's bytes exactly as they sit in the `place` instruction: `PieceMessage` is its
//! first argument, so its Borsh encoding is the instruction's data from byte 8 (after the discriminator). The
//! transaction carries an Ed25519 precompile instruction just before `place` that verifies the signature over
//! that range of `place`'s own data, so the piece is in the transaction once, not twice. The program then checks
//! the precompile instruction was pointed at exactly that range and at the player's session key.
