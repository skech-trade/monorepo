//! skech on Solana: draw ink ahead of the Bitcoin price, and the ink the price runs through pays.
//!
//! The house holds no money. Players deposit USDC; every stake goes into one pool; every hit is paid from it. The
//! house takes a fee on every stake and on every profit, and nothing else. When the pool cannot pay a hit, the
//! winner is owed IOU shares that grow every second and are paid off, by anyone, as the pool refills.
//!
//! The same game as `packages/contracts/evm`, built for how Solana works: one piece per transaction so players
//! place in parallel, an Ed25519 session key checked by the precompile against the piece in the instruction, the
//! oracle's quote and bars attested by it signing the transaction, the price in a ring of the last few minutes,
//! and every bet an account that is closed, rent back, once it is decided.
//!
//! Prices carry 8 decimals, USDC 6, time is in milliseconds on the exchange's clock, chances are in billionths.
