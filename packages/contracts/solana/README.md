# Solana contracts

The game: one Anchor program, `skech`, on Solana. It is the same game as the EVM contracts in [`../evm`](../evm) (the same ladder, fees, pool and IOUs), which are kept in the repo as its reference, not deployed or used, built for how Solana works.

## How it differs from the EVM game, and why

| | EVM (`../evm`) | Solana |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Placing | one `place` per second, every player's pieces in it | **one piece per transaction**: transactions that write different accounts run in parallel, and a placement writes only the player's account, their new bet and the pool |
| The stroke | in an event, up to 24 KB | **only its hash** is signed; the relayer keeps the points (a transaction is 1232 bytes, and nothing reads strokes from chain) |
| Session keys | P-256, the browser's WebCrypto key, via a P-256 precompile | **Ed25519**, checked by the Ed25519 precompile over the piece *as it sits in the `place` instruction*, so its bytes are in the transaction once |
| Quotes and bars | EIP-712, signed by the oracle and checked on chain | the oracle **signs the transaction**: the quote and the bar are instruction data it vouches for, with no second signature to check |
| The price | every second's bar kept forever | a **ring of the last 240 seconds** per market (9.6 KB, rent once). A bar may be posted up to **200 s** after its second (`BAR_LATE`), so a posted second is never overwritten through its slot |
| A stalled oracle | bars can be posted any time later | once a band's second is past `BAR_LATE` unposted, **`expire`** (anyone may) gives its whole stake back, as the EVM game's does, and closes the bet |
| Bets | stored forever | **an account per bet, closed when decided**; the rent goes back to the relayer, so the float is only what is live |
| Replays | a stored bet id | the bet account, at the one address a piece has (its canonical bump), lives until every band is decided **and** its piece's placing window is over; a replay before then is refused, after it is late. `place` must be a top-level instruction, so another program cannot pass on a piece the key never signed |
| IOUs | an ERC-20 with a growing index | the same shares and index, **on the holder's `Player` account**: redeemable by anyone, who is paid 10% of the growth into their own `Player` account as in the EVM game (none if they send none), not transferable (a token would need Token-2022 transfer hooks for a feature nothing uses) |
| Deposits | EIP-3009 authorization | `deposit` signed by the wallet, or `sweep` on a standing SPL approval, so USDC that lands in the wallet moves in by itself |
| Gas | players never hold the chain's coin | players never hold SOL: the relayer is fee payer and pays every rent |
| Initializing | the deployer | **only the program's upgrade authority**, so nobody can take a fresh deployment first; a vault someone created first is used, not a block; USDC must be an SPL Token mint (Token-2022's extensions could leave the vault short) |
| Terms | set by `initialize` | the same, `Config::DEFAULT` = `SkechGame.initialize`'s (a test on each side reads the Solidity) |

Accounts: `Game` (terms, oracle, vault; read-only to players), `Pool` (the pool, the fees, the IOU index), `Market` and `Bars` per market, `Player` per wallet, `Bet` per piece, and for SKT `Rewards` (one: shares, the holders' accumulator and its last eras, their funds, the tracked gain, the decay's clock, live bets' liability, SKT's terms) and `Holder` per wallet (shares and their era, earnings, basis). All are PDAs of the program.

SKT (`src/skt.rs`, and `docs/HOW-IT-WORKS.md` § SKT) is Solana's alone: every band that misses mints on its odds-weighted loss (the profit fee counted), SKT decays with a half-life, no wallet mints past 10% of all of it, and holders share 3 of the 4 stake-fee points, 8 of the 10 profit-fee points and 75% of the pool's surplus over its reserve and live bets' worst (`share_surplus`; the treasury takes the other 25%). The EVM game has none; the conformance cases with SKT terms run on Solana only.

## Numbers (LiteSVM, `snapshots/compute.json`)

| | compute units |
| --- | --- |
| place, 1 band | 34,300 |
| place, 32 bands | 99,600 |
| each bump of the bet's address below 255 | 1,500 more |
| a bar alone | 18,900 |
| a bar and 4 bets settled (1, 8, 16, 32 bands) | 109,900 |
| the same, opening the 4 players' SKT holders | 135,800 to 143,300 (by their bumps) |
| a bar and 9 bets of 32 bands, every holder opened (the most a transaction holds) | 436,200 |
| settling, part by part: the instruction / each bet / each band / each band decided / each holder opened | 13,000 / 9,700 / 850 / 800 / 6,300 |
| claim | 13,800 |
| redeem | 13,300 |
| share_surplus | 16,100 |

`place` finds the bet's canonical bump itself (so a piece has one address), 1,500 units for each bump it tries below 255: the snapshot is taken at 255, and the relayer adds `place_per_bump` for the bump it already knows.

The widest piece, 32 bands, is **1,153 bytes** in a v0 transaction with the lookup table the deploy creates (the limit is 1,232); a settlement holds nine bets of different players, each its bet, player and holder. The relayer sets every compute limit from `snapshots/compute.json`, a settlement's by its parts. The program is built for speed, not size (`opt-level = 3`): `z` would save 110 KB of rent (~0.8 SOL, once) and double every instruction's compute units.

## Tools

- Anchor **0.32.1**, pinned in `Anchor.toml`: `avm install 0.32.1` once; `anchor` uses it here without changing your default.
- The Solana CLI 2.x or newer, and Rust `1.89.0` (`rust-toolchain.toml`).

## Build, test, generate

```bash
# from packages/contracts
bun run solana:build      # target/deploy/skech.so and target/idl/skech.json
bun run solana:test       # the suite in LiteSVM: the program as compiled, no validator
bun run solana:snapshot   # rewrite snapshots/compute.json
bun run solana:client     # regenerate the TypeScript client (client/) from the IDL, with Codama
bun test solana/sdk.test.ts
```

`tests/src/attacks.rs` is every way found to cheat the game, each shown refused. One of them builds `tests/cpi-probe`, a small program that calls `place` from inside itself (never deployed), with `cargo build-sbf` on first use.

`tests/vectors/ladder.json` is the ladder as `@skech/core` computes it (`bun tests/vectors/ladder.ts`, `--check` to see it is up to date); the Rust tests check the program against all 15,552 rows, and `evm/test/LadderVectors.t.sol` checks `SkechLadder` against the same file. `tests/vectors/piece.json` is a piece's bytes as the program reads them; `sdk.test.ts` checks the TypeScript encodes the same (`SNAPSHOT=1 cargo test -p tests` rewrites it).

`sdk.ts` is the TypeScript side: networks, PDAs, the bytes a session key signs (`pieceBytes`) and the Ed25519 instruction that goes before `place`. It re-exports the generated client.

## Deploy

```bash
bun run deploy:solana                              # SKECH_SOLANA_CLUSTER, devnet when unset
SKECH_SOLANA_CLUSTER=localnet bun run deploy:solana # a local validator, with a local USDC
bun run deploy:solana --mainnet                    # mainnet-beta: required, it spends real SOL
bun run deploy:solana --skip-program --set-config  # set a running game's terms to the defaults (SOLANA_CONFIG='{"feeBps":300}' to differ)
```

Run again on a game already set up, it leaves the game as it is and writes the deployment from the game account: its mint (on a local validator, the stand-in made the first time), vault, token program, treasury, oracle and admin.

It deploys the program, initializes the game (the deployer is admin, and must be the upgrade authority), opens BTC-USD, creates the lookup table and writes `../deployments/solana-<cluster>.json`. The keys are in the script's header. The program keypair, `target/deploy/skech-keypair.json`, is not in git: whoever deploys needs the one whose address is `declare_id!` in `lib.rs` (on a fresh checkout, `anchor keys sync` makes a new program id, for a new deployment).

## Upgrading a deployed program

The accounts keep their layout. Bets live seconds, so before upgrading, stop placing (stop the relayer's placements, or pause) and let the live bets settle, about 35 seconds; then `solana program deploy` over the same program id, regenerate the client, and restart the relayer with the new `snapshots/compute.json`. A game set up under the old defaults keeps its terms (a 2% fee, $10 a dot, $1,000 a piece): `deploy:solana --skip-program --set-config` moves it to the defaults (4% of stakes, 10% of profit).

Upgrading a game set up before SKT: once the program is upgraded, nothing places until SKT starts; bets already live settle and expire without it, minting nothing. `deploy:solana --skip-program` sends `init_rewards`, which creates `Rewards` and moves the fees to 4% and 10% in the same instruction (SKT's split must fit inside them), makes a lookup table with `rewards` in it and writes it to the deployment file; then deploy the relayer with that file. Bets placed before the upgrade settle as before and mint nothing.

## Before mainnet

- Build verifiably (`anchor build --verifiable`) and verify the deployed program against this source (`solana-verify`).
- Hand the upgrade authority and the admin to a multisig (Squads): `solana program set-upgrade-authority`, then `propose_admin` / `accept_admin`.
- Give the oracle its own key, apart from the admin's.
- Use a staked RPC (SWQoS) and priority fees for the relayer: placements must land within 3 seconds.
- An audit.
